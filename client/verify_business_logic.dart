  print('\n✅ Business logic implementation complete!');
  print('🔧 Key changes made:');
  print('   - _buildDefaultContext() always returns "default" business ID');
  print('   - Business slug extraction works for routes like /g3, /kako, etc.');
  print('   - Provider invalidation optimized to avoid unnecessary rebuilds');
  print('   - Circular dependency issues resolved with ref.read usage');

  print('\n🚀 Ready for testing in the running app!');
