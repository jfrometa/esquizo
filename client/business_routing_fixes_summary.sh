# Business Routing Fixes - Final Verification Script
# This script summarizes all the fixes applied and provides testing instructions

echo "🔧 BUSINESS ROUTING FIXES - FINAL SUMMARY"
echo "==========================================="

echo ""
echo "📋 ISSUES THAT WERE FIXED:"
echo "1. ✅ Business route /g3 redirecting to / instead of staying on /g3"
echo "2. ✅ Multiple redirect loops causing app to reload 2-3 times"
echo "3. ✅ OptimizedBusinessWrapper using wrong route parameters"
echo "4. ✅ Auth state refresh causing excessive router rebuilds"
echo "5. ✅ WebUtils path detection needing better debugging"

echo ""
echo "🔧 SPECIFIC CHANGES MADE:"
echo ""
echo "1. OPTIMIZED BUSINESS WRAPPERS:"
echo "   File: lib/src/routing/optimized_business_wrappers.dart"
echo "   - OptimizedHomeScreenWrapper: route: '/' → route: '/\$businessSlug'"
echo "   - OptimizedMenuScreenWrapper: route: '/menu' → route: '/\$businessSlug/menu'"
echo "   - OptimizedCartScreenWrapper: route: '/carrito' → route: '/\$businessSlug/carrito'"
echo "   - OptimizedProfileScreenWrapper: route: '/cuenta' → route: '/\$businessSlug/cuenta'"
echo "   - OptimizedOrdersScreenWrapper: route: '/ordenes' → route: '/\$businessSlug/ordenes'"
echo "   - OptimizedAdminScreenWrapper: route: '/admin' → route: '/\$businessSlug/admin'"

echo ""
echo "2. AUTH STATE REFRESH OPTIMIZATION:"
echo "   File: lib/src/routing/go_router_refresh_stream.dart"
echo "   - Added .distinct() filter to prevent duplicate auth notifications"
echo "   - Removed complex debounce logic that could cause issues"
echo "   - Added better debug logging for auth state changes"

echo ""
echo "3. WEBUTILS ENHANCEMENT:"
echo "   File: lib/src/utils/web/web_utils_web.dart"
echo "   - Enhanced logging for path detection debugging"
echo "   - Better path cleaning and validation"
echo "   - Improved error handling for edge cases"

echo ""
echo "🎯 EXPECTED BEHAVIOR AFTER FIXES:"
echo ""
echo "SCENARIO 1: Navigate to http://localhost:62129/g3"
echo "  ✅ URL should stay as /g3 (not redirect to /)"
echo "  ✅ Business context should load for 'g3' business"
echo "  ✅ setBusinessNavigation should be called with ('/g3', not '/')"
echo "  ✅ No multiple page reloads or redirect loops"
echo "  ✅ g3 business data should display correctly"

echo ""
echo "SCENARIO 2: Navigate to http://localhost:62129/g3/menu"
echo "  ✅ URL should stay as /g3/menu"
echo "  ✅ Business context should remain 'g3'"
echo "  ✅ Menu screen should display with g3 business data"
echo "  ✅ Navigation should be smooth without reloads"

echo ""
echo "SCENARIO 3: Auth state changes"
echo "  ✅ Router should rebuild less frequently"
echo "  ✅ No excessive refresh cycles"
echo "  ✅ Business context should be preserved"

echo ""
echo "🧪 MANUAL TESTING CHECKLIST:"
echo "□ Open http://localhost:62129/g3"
echo "□ Verify URL stays as /g3 in address bar"
echo "□ Check browser console for debug logs (F12 → Console)"
echo "□ Look for logs: '🌐 WebUtils raw path: \"/g3\"'"
echo "□ Look for logs: '🔄 Setting business navigation: g3 -> /g3'"
echo "□ Verify no redirect loops (page should load once)"
echo "□ Navigate to /g3/menu and verify URL preservation"
echo "□ Test /kako route for comparison"

echo ""
echo "🔍 DEBUG LOGS TO LOOK FOR:"
echo "✅ '🌐 WebUtils raw path: \"/g3\"' (correct path detection)"
echo "✅ '🏢 Valid business slug detected: g3' (slug validation)"
echo "✅ '🔄 Setting business navigation: g3 -> /g3' (correct route)"
echo "✅ '🏠 Optimized home screen for: g3' (wrapper execution)"
echo "❌ Should NOT see: '🔄 Setting business navigation: g3 -> /' (wrong route)"

echo ""
echo "📁 FILES CHANGED:"
echo "• lib/src/routing/optimized_business_wrappers.dart"
echo "• lib/src/routing/go_router_refresh_stream.dart"
echo "• lib/src/utils/web/web_utils_web.dart"

echo ""
echo "🚀 IF TESTING STILL SHOWS ISSUES:"
echo "1. Check browser console (F12) for JavaScript errors"
echo "2. Verify Firebase is properly initialized"
echo "3. Check if business 'g3' exists in database"
echo "4. Try hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)"
echo "5. Check network tab for any failed requests"

echo ""
echo "==========================================="
echo "💡 The main fix was changing OptimizedBusinessWrapper route parameters"
echo "   from relative paths like '/' to full business paths like '/g3'"
echo "   This prevents the business navigation from defaulting to home route."
