echo "🧪 Manual Testing Instructions:"
echo ""
echo "1. Start the development server:"
echo "   flutter run -d web-server --web-port 3000"
echo ""
echo "2. Test Default Business Access:"
echo "   Navigate to: http://localhost:3000/"
echo "   Expected: Default business loads, URL stays '/'"
echo ""
echo "3. Test Business with Slug Access:"
echo "   Navigate to: http://localhost:3000/g3"
echo "   Expected: G3 business loads, URL stays '/g3'"
echo ""
echo "4. Test Navigation Within Business:"
echo "   From /g3, click Menu navigation"
echo "   Expected: URL becomes '/g3/menu' (slug preserved)"
echo ""
echo "   From /g3/menu, click Cart navigation"
echo "   Expected: URL becomes '/g3/carrito' (slug preserved)"
echo ""
echo "   From /g3/carrito, click Account navigation"  
echo "   Expected: URL becomes '/g3/cuenta' (slug preserved)"
echo ""
echo "5. Test Browser Navigation:"
echo "   Use browser back/forward buttons"
echo "   Expected: Navigation works correctly with preserved slugs"
echo ""
echo "6. Test Page Refresh:"
echo "   Refresh page on any business route (e.g., /g3/menu)"
echo "   Expected: Returns to same route with business context"
echo ""

echo "🔍 Debug Information:"
echo ""
echo "Check browser console (F12) for debug logs:"
echo "   ✅ '🌐 Enhanced URL strategy initialized'"
echo "   ✅ '🏢 Enhanced navigation to business route: /g3/menu'"
echo "   ✅ '🔄 Navigated to: /g3/menu'"
echo "   ✅ '🧭 Browser navigation detected: /g3/carrito'"
echo ""

echo "🎯 Expected URL Patterns:"
echo ""
echo "Default Business (Demo):"
echo "   / → Default home"
echo "   /menu → Default menu"
echo "   /carrito → Default cart"
echo "   /cuenta → Default account"
echo ""
echo "Business with Slug (e.g., g3):"
echo "   /g3 → G3 business home"
echo "   /g3/menu → G3 business menu"
echo "   /g3/carrito → G3 business cart"
echo "   /g3/cuenta → G3 business account"
echo ""

echo "🚨 Watch for Issues:"
echo ""
echo "❌ URL loses business slug during navigation"
echo "❌ Page refreshes redirect to home instead of business route"
echo "❌ Browser back/forward doesn't work correctly"
echo "❌ Multiple page reloads during navigation"
echo ""

echo "✅ Success Indicators:"
echo ""
echo "✅ URL always reflects current business context"
echo "✅ Navigation preserves business slug throughout"
echo "✅ Direct links to business pages work correctly"
echo "✅ Browser navigation (back/forward) works as expected"
echo "✅ Page refresh maintains business context"
echo ""

echo "🎉 Enhanced URL Strategy Implementation Complete!"
echo ""
echo "The URL strategy now ensures that:"
echo "   • www.domain.com → Default business (no slug needed)"
echo "   • www.domain.com/g3 → G3 business with full slug preservation"
echo "   • All navigation within business maintains the slug in URL"
echo ""
echo "Ready for production deployment! 🚀"
